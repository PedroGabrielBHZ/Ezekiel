# Jewish Heritage Preservation Project

This project aims to safeguard Jewish heritage by scraping cultural content available online.

## Overview

In an effort to preserve and disseminate the rich cultural heritage of the Jewish community, this project focuses on collecting and organizing cultural content available on the internet. The primary source of this content is the Zemirot Database, a comprehensive online resource of Jewish songs (Zemirot), liturgy, and other Jewish cultural content.

The project involves scraping the Zemirot Database to collect song lyrics, translations, and other related content. This data is then organized and stored for future use and analysis.

## How it works

The project uses Python and the BeautifulSoup library to scrape the Zemirot Database. The scraped data includes song links, lyrics in both transliteration and Hebrew, and translations. This data is then stored in text files for easy access and use.

## Future Directions

The goal is to expand the scope of the project to include other online resources of Jewish cultural content. Additionally, we plan to implement data analysis and visualization tools to explore patterns and trends in the collected data.

## Contribution

Contributions to the project are welcome. Whether it's improving the scraping process, adding new data sources, or implementing data analysis features, your input can help in preserving Jewish cultural heritage.
