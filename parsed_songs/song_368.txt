Transliteration:
Wake up, Yidden, From this dream of Golus, Get ready to greet Moshiach Tzidkeinu
 
Geulah is coming 
swiftly towards us, 
Hinai Zeh Omaid Achar Kosleinu
There will be no more wars, 
no more lions' roars
Umolo Ho'Oretz Day-oh, 
 
In a mikdosh built of flames,
We'll give thanks to his name.
And march to the Ge'ulah with the Rebbe Shlit"a!

Hebrew:


Translation:
It is an English song so it doesn't have a translati​on.
 
Popul​ar with Chabad chasidim.​
