Hebrew:
אִלּוּ הוֹצִיאָנוּ מִמִצְרַים  וְלֹא עָשָׂה בָּהֶם שְׁפָטִים,			דַּיֵינוּ. 
אִלוּ עָשָׂה בָּהֶם שְׁפָטִים, ולֹא עָשָׂה בֵאלֹהֵיהֶם,  			דַּיֵינוּ. 
אִלוּ עָשָׂה בֵאלֹהֵיהֶם, וְלֹא הָרַג אֶת בְּכוֹרֵיהֶם,			דַּיֵינוּ. 
אִלוּ הָרַג אֶת בְּכוֹרֵיהֶם וְלֹא נָתַן לָנוּ אֶת מָמוֹנָם,			דַּיֵינוּ. 
אִלוּ נָתַן לָנוּ אֶת מָמוֹנָם וְלֹא קָרַע לָנוּ אֶת הַיָּם,			דַּיֵינוּ. 
אִלוּ קָרַע לָנוּ אֶת הַיָּם וְלֹא הֶעֱבֵירָנוּ בְּתוֹכוֹ בֶּחָרָבָה,			דַּיֵינוּ. 
אִלוּ הֶעֱבֵירָנוּ בְּתוֹכוֹ בֶּחָרָבָה וְלֹא שְׁקַע צֶַָרֵנוּ בְּתוֹכוֹ			דַּיֵינוּ. 
אִלוּ  שִׁקַע צֶַָרֵנוּ בְּתוֹכוֹ וְלֹא סִפֵּק צָרְכֵּנוּ בּמִדְבָּר אַרְבָּעִים שָׁנָה	דַּיֵינוּ. 
אִלוּ סִפֵּק צָרְכֵּנוּ בּמִדְבָּר אַרְבָּעִים שָׁנָה ולֹא הֶאֱכִילָנוּ אֶת הַמָּן	דַּיֵינוּ. 
אִלוּ  הֶאֱכִילָנוּ אֶת הַמָּן וְלֹא נָתַן לָנוּ אֶת הַשַׁבָּת,			דַּיֵינוּ. 
אִלוּ נָתַן לָנוּ אֶת הַשַׁבָּת, וְלֹא קֵרְבָנוּ לִפְנֵי הַר סִינַי,			דַּיֵינוּ. 
אִלוּ קֵרְבָנוּ לִפְנֵי הַר סִינַי, וְלֹא נַָתַן לָנוּ אֶת הַתּוֹרָה.			דַּיֵינוּ. 
אִלוּ נַָתַן לָנוּ אֶת הַתּוֹרָה וְלֹא הִכְנִיסָנוּ לְאֶרֶץ  יִשְׂרָאֵל,		דַּיֵינוּ. 
אִלוּ  הִכְנִיסָנוּ לְאֶרֶץ  יִשְׂרָאֵל וְלֹא בָנָה לָנוּ אֶת בֵּית הַבְּחִירָה		דַּיֵינוּ.

If He had brought us out of Egypt
but had not executed judgments​​ against [the Egyptians​​],
it would have been enough for us!

If He had split the sea for us,
but had not brought us through it on dry land,
it would have been enough for us!
 
If He had brought us through it on dry land,
but had not drowned our oppressor​​s within it,
it would have been enough for us!
