ראו בנים גבורתו שבחו והודו לשמו. ומלכותו ברצון קבלו עליהם. משה ובני ישראל לך ענו שירה בשמחה רבה ואמרו כולם.

Translation:
Then his children beheld his might. They praised and gave thanks unto his name and willingly​ accepted his sovereign​ty. Moses and the children of Israel sang a song unto thee with great joy, saying, all of them:
 
(Who is like unto thee, O Lord, among the mighty ones? Who is like unto thee, glorious in holiness,​ revered in praises, doing wonders?)​
