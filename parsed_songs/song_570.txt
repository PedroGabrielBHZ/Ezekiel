Hebrew:
פָּדָה בְשָׁלוֹם נַפְשִׁי, מִקְּרָב-לִי:    כִּי-בְרַבִּים, הָיוּ עִמָּדִי.
 
יִשְׁמַע אֵל, וְיַעֲנֵם-- וְיֹשֵׁב קֶדֶם, סֶלָה:
אֲשֶׁר אֵין חֲלִיפוֹת לָמוֹ; וְלֹא יָרְאוּ אֱלֹהִים.
 
שָׁלַח יָדָיו, בִּשְׁלֹמָיו; חִלֵּל בְּרִיתוֹ.
 
חָלְקוּ, מַחְמָאֹת פִּיו-- וּקְרָב-לִבּוֹ:
רַכּוּ דְבָרָיו מִשֶּׁמֶן; וְהֵמָּה פְתִחוֹת.
 
הַשְׁלֵךְ עַל-יְהוָה, יְהָבְךָ-- וְהוּא יְכַלְכְּלֶךָ:
לֹא-יִתֵּן לְעוֹלָם מוֹט-- לַצַּדִּיק.
 
וְאַתָּה אֱלֹהִים,  תּוֹרִדֵם לִבְאֵר שַׁחַת--
אַנְשֵׁי דָמִים וּמִרְמָה,  לֹא-יֶחֱצוּ יְמֵיהֶם;
וַאֲנִי, אֶבְטַח-בָּךְ.

Translation:
He hath redeemed my soul in peace so that none came nigh me; for they were many that strove with me.
 
God shall hear, and humble them, even He that is enthroned​ of old, Selah such as have no changes, and fear not God.
 
He hath put forth his hands against them that were at peace with him; he hath profaned his covenant.​
 
Smoot​her than cream were the speeches of his mouth, but his heart was war;
his words were softer than oil, yet were they keen-edge​d swords.
 
Cast thy burden upon the LORD, and He will sustain thee;
He will never suffer the righteous​ to be moved.
 
But Thou, O God, wilt bring them down into the nethermos​t pit;
men of blood and deceit shall not live out half their days;
but as for me, I will trust in Thee.
