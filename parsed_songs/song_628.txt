Transliteration:
Utzu etza vetufar; 
Dabru davar velo yakum, 
Ki imanu El.

Hebrew:
עֻצוּ עֵצָה, וְתֻפָר; 
דַּבְּרוּ דָבָר וְלֹא יָקוּם,
כִּי עִמָּנוּ אֵל.

Translation:
They have devised schemes but they have been foiled, they have made declarati​ons [against us], but they will not be fulfilled​, because God is with us!
