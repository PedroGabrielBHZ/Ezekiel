Transliteration:
This is an instructional ditty for teaching a traditional tune for Shabbat Mincha. The first sentence of the ditty is an excerpt from an old commercial for the cereal Crispy Critters: 
 
"[It's] the one and only cereal that comes in the shape of animals." (From the Crispy Critters advertisement.)
 
"It is so good and yummy, I want it in my tummy." (Not in the advertisement. ויש אומרים "tastes so good and yummy" במקום "is so good and yummy")
