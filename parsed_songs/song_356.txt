Transliteration:
This song is a nigun, no words. It occured to me a couple years back while trying to write other music. I could not shake it or get it out of my head for anything.  Vinky is the nickname by which my youngest brother and his children call me.
 
I have applied this nigun in shul to Lecha Dodi. I have also found it fits well for Yah Ribon when singing  Zemirot
